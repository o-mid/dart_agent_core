## 2.1.5

- Keep `deactivate_skills` from throwing when `AgentState.activeSkills` is still null.
- Skip unknown names in `activeSkills` while composing tools, so a stale persisted skill cannot crash the run.
- Propagate worker `AgentException` control-flow codes (`cancelled`, `loopDetection`, `stopByController`) from `delegate_task` to the parent run instead of soft-erroring them; ordinary worker failures remain tool error text.

## 2.1.4

- Fix Gemini tool-result history by sending `functionResponse` parts with the supported `user` role, restoring function-calling compatibility with Gemini 3.6 while retaining compatibility with earlier models.
- Add regression coverage for Gemini function-call and function-response roles and IDs.

## 2.1.3

- Allow `ImagePart` to carry a hosted `url` in addition to base64 data.
- OpenAI Chat Completions and Responses send that URL as `image_url` instead of wrapping it as a data URI.
- Anthropic Messages uses `source.type: url` for hosted images. Gemini and Bedrock still require base64.

## 2.1.2

- Stop all tool execution when an agent run is already cancelled, including directory-skill JavaScript runtimes.
- Keep the built-in `RunJavaScript` tool on the standard tool-execution path so `AgentCallToolContext` remains available to runtimes and bridge handlers, without intercepting user-defined tools that share its name.
- Add `Tool.resultIsError` for tools that return sentinel error values while preserving their existing return type, with regression coverage for dispatch, cancellation, and context propagation.

## 2.1.1

- Fix OpenAI-compatible streaming responses that report cumulative usage on content, reasoning, audio, tool-call, or terminal chunks.
- Preserve streamed payloads while retaining the latest usage snapshot, and combine trailing usage-only chunks with the pending finish reason and tool calls.
- Add regression coverage for continuous usage, combined terminal payloads, and standard usage-only terminal chunks.

## 2.1.0

- Add Model Context Protocol (MCP) support to `StatefulAgent` through the new `McpManager`, `McpSession`, and `McpConnectionConfig` APIs.
- Support local stdio MCP servers on Dart IO platforms and remote Streamable HTTP MCP servers on all supported platforms, including Web.
- Add progressive capability disclosure with six fixed bridge tools for discovering and invoking MCP tools, resources, and prompts without placing every server schema in the system prompt.
- Support multiple named MCP servers, complete paginated capability discovery, custom HTTP headers, and explicit stdio environment overrides.
- Keep MCP session cleanup scoped to each agent run, reject duplicate server names before connecting, and avoid duplicate stdio server processes.
- Add a runnable MCP example, English and Chinese MCP guides, and real stdio integration tests covering process lifecycle, environment propagation, pagination, and duplicate-name validation.

## 2.0.5

- Support multiple file-system Skill roots through `skillDirectoryPaths`.
- Ignore blank Skill roots when enabling directory mode and authorizing JavaScript execution, preventing an empty entry from expanding access to the current working directory.
- De-duplicate normalized roots and `SKILL.md` paths so duplicate or overlapping roots do not break name-based Skill activation.
- Add regression tests and update the English and Chinese Skill configuration documentation.

## 2.0.4

- Fix repeated `systemPromptHistory` / `toolsHistory` entries across separate agent runs by initializing prompt/tool hashes from the last recorded state snapshot instead of starting each run from `null`.
- Preserve the existing change-detection semantics: system prompts are compared by content hash, and tools are compared by sorted tool-name hash.

## 2.0.3

- **BREAKING**: replace `systemCallback`, legacy pre/post tool hooks, turn-completion hooks, and controller request/response loop controls with the unified `AgentHook` pipeline. `AgentController` is now used for observation events; flow control belongs in hooks.
- Add typed hook phases for `beforeRun`, `beforeModelCall`, `onModelChunk`, `afterModelCall`, `beforeToolCall`, `afterToolCall`, `onTurnCompletion`, `beforePersistState`, `afterPersistState`, and `afterRun`.
- Hooks can rewrite current model requests without persistence, or directly mutate `context.state` when data should survive later turns or resume. `ModelCallHookResult.messagesToPersist` was removed so hook outcomes only describe flow control.
- Add hook-focused tests and runnable examples covering model input rewriting, synthetic model responses, streaming chunk transforms, model retries, tool deny/defer/rewrite/stop, final-turn continuation, abort handling, and state persistence hooks.
- `resume()` / `resumeStream()` now accept `cancelToken`, `useStream`, and `maxTurns`, matching `run()` / `runStream()` controls.

## 2.0.2

- **Security hardening** — comprehensive audit and fix of credential handling, error exposure, and logging:
  - **Gemini**: move API key from URL query string to `x-goog-api-key` header (prevents exposure in server/proxy logs).
  - **All clients**: keep provider error response bodies in thrown exceptions so callers can debug 4xx request issues.
  - **Claude / Bedrock**: avoid logging raw provider error bodies; log status context while preserving error details in exceptions.
  - **All clients**: make `apiKey` fields private (`_apiKey`); Bedrock `accessKeyId` / `secretAccessKey` also privatized.
  - **Gemini**: fix `maxRetryDelayMs` default (was 3000, now 30000 — previous value was less than `initialRetryDelayMs`, defeating the cap).
  - **FileStateStorage / RecordingStore**: truncate session/hash IDs in error log messages to prevent enumeration.

## 2.0.1

- **Fix**: `StepStatus` serialization — convert to enhanced enum with stable `name` field (`pending`/`in_progress`/`completed`/`cancelled`) to ensure backward-compatible JSON persistence regardless of Dart identifier naming.
- Simplify planner code with Dart 3.0+ `.indexed` + pattern destructuring for indexed iteration, and `firstWhere` + `orElse` for status parsing.

## 2.0.0

- **Web & WASM support**: the package now supports all 6 platforms (iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux) and is WebAssembly-compatible. Platform-specific concerns (file-system state storage, HTTP adapters, JavaScript runtime) are resolved at compile time via conditional exports, so the public API is identical across native and web.
- **BREAKING**: `FileStateStorage` now takes a `String directoryPath` instead of a `Directory`. Migrate `FileStateStorage(dir)` to `FileStateStorage(dir.path)`. On web, prefer an in-memory or `localStorage`-backed `StateStorage` rather than `FileStateStorage`.
- Network errors from the OpenAI, Gemini, and Responses clients are now surfaced via `DioException` instead of `dart:io` `SocketException`, removing `dart:io` from the public reachable surface.
- Add a Platform Support section (with a web-safe API-key snippet) to both READMEs.
- Internal style cleanup: lowerCamelCase identifiers and braced flow-control statements; pana static-analysis now scores 50/50 (160/160 overall).

## 1.0.14

- Add agent run lifecycle hooks.
- Fix OpenAI duplicate tool call ids.
- Align agent run state and tool call ids.
- Prevent failed retries from bloating agent history.

## 1.0.13

- Fix `EventBus`: ignore late events after `close()` to prevent errors when events are published during teardown.
- Add unit tests for `LoopDetector`, `Planner`, and `EventBus`.

## 1.0.12

- Add `EvalTranscriptRecorder`: automatically captures execution traces (messages, tool calls, reasoning steps, token/turn metrics) from `AgentController` during eval runs — harnesses no longer need to manually build transcripts.
- `EvalRunner` now integrates `EvalTranscriptRecorder` per trial, producing richer `Transcript` data with timing metrics (time-to-first-token, time-to-last-token).
- Simplify `AgentHarnessFactory` interface — harnesses focus on running the agent and returning `Outcome`, transcript recording is handled by the framework.
- Update eval guide docs and examples to reflect the new recorder-based workflow.

## 1.0.11

- Add evaluation subsystem under `package:dart_agent_core/eval.dart` (separate entry point — no impact on existing `dart_agent_core.dart` consumers).
  - Core: `EvalTask` / `EvalSuite` / `EvalRunner` / `Trial` / `Outcome` / `Transcript` / `EvalEnvironment` / `AgentHarnessFactory`.
  - Graders: `CodeGrader` (rule / script / classification), `ModelGrader` (LLM-as-judge with required `Unknown` escape hatch), `HumanGrader`.
  - LLM record / replay: hash-based `RecordingLLMClient` / `ReplayLLMClient`, `FileRecordingStore`, per-trial `cacheSalt` so `trialsPerRun > 1` does not collapse into a single cache entry.
  - Rate limiting: `RpmRateLimitGate`, `TpmRateLimitGate`, `NoopRateLimitGate` — decoupled from concurrency, replay hits skip the gate.
  - Metrics: `pass@k` (Codex unbiased estimator), `pass^k` (empirical), `ClassificationMetrics`, bucket pass rates, grader means.
  - Reporting: `FileReportStore`, `diffRunReports`, markdown + JSON output.
  - Suite health: `SuiteHealthAnalyzer` — graduation candidates and broken-task detection across runs.
  - Calibration: `JudgeCalibrator` — Spearman / Pearson / MAE against a human-labeled golden set.
  - Loaders: code-defined suites and JSON file-tree-defined suites via `loadEvalSuiteFromDir` + `GraderRegistry`.
  - Observability: `JsonlTraceExporter`, `CompositeTraceExporter`, and built-in `LangfuseTraceExporter` (background batched ingestion to Langfuse cloud or self-hosted, exponential-backoff retries, schema aligned with langfuse v4).
- Add `bin/transcripts.dart` CLI: `list` / `show` / `diff` / `export` for persisted run reports, runnable via `dart run dart_agent_core:transcripts`.
- Add three runnable end-to-end demos under `example/eval_demo/`: `calculator/` and `card_agent/` (code-defined suites), `pkm_agent/` (file-defined suite with fixtures); plus a 130-line self-contained `example/min_eval/main.dart`.
- Add `doc/eval-guide.md` (English) and `doc/eval-guide.zh-CN.md` covering core concepts, components, two suite definition styles, three grader styles, metrics, record/replay, Langfuse export, cross-run health, judge calibration, CLI, and an API cheat sheet. Linked from each README.

## 1.0.10

- Update README and documentation.

## 1.0.9

- **BREAKING**: Replace `SystemCallback` return type from Dart Record `(SystemMessage?, List<Tool>, List<LLMMessage>)` to `SystemCallbackResult` class for broader SDK compatibility and clearer semantics. Callers using `systemCallback` must update to access `.systemMessage`, `.tools`, `.requestMessages` properties instead of positional destructuring.

## 1.0.8

- Lower Dart SDK minimum constraint from `^3.10.4` to `^3.9.2` to support Flutter 3.35 and HarmonyOS ecosystem.
- Add `ToolParameterMode.object` for tools: receive all arguments as a single `Map<String, dynamic>` instead of positional/named parameter mapping via `Function.apply`.
- Update tool documentation in README, README.zh-CN, and `doc/tools_and_planning.md` with object mode usage and examples.

This library is part of the [Memex](https://www.memexlab.ai/changelog) project by [Memex Lab](https://memexlab.ai).

## 1.0.7

- Add `baseUrl` / `region` to request log messages across all LLM clients for easier debugging.
- Add comprehensive provider documentation for Chinese README (Kimi, Qwen, GLM, Doubao, MiniMax, Ollama, OpenRouter, Claude direct).
- Add OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible provider sections to `doc/providers.md`.

## 1.0.6

- Fix `OpenAIClient` not handling `reasoning_content` for thinking/reasoning models (e.g. `kimi-k2-thinking`, `o1`, `deepseek-r1`).
- Parse `reasoning_content` from both non-streaming and streaming responses into `ModelMessage.thought`.
- Re-send `reasoning_content` in assistant messages during multi-turn conversations to satisfy API validation.
- Add `simple_agent_with_kimi_vision_example.dart` for image analysis with Kimi.

## 1.0.5

- Add examples for MiniMax, Kimi, Volcengine Seed, Zhipu GLM, and Qwen via OpenAI-compatible API.
- Fix `OpenAIResponseTransformer` not extracting `finish_reason` when provider sends it in the same chunk as `usage` (e.g. GLM).
- Fix double JSON encoding of `FunctionCall.arguments` in `OpenAIClient` and `ResponsesClient` request body.

## 1.0.4
